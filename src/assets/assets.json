I recommend doing it multiple times. At the end, your score will be recorded with your name or initials, and you can see high scores from anyone who has done the quiz on your web browser! \n \n To use this web app, simply go to the Github pages link and click start or view leaderboard if you'd like to scope out the competition first. If you run out of time, you get a score of zero, if you answer incorrectly and the time deduction reduces the time to zero, you get a score of zero.",
