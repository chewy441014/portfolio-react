                    <p> I have a long history with writing code, as far back as middle school when I had my own domain for less than a year; I have been growing my skills continuously since then. Later in college, I used Matlab in a mechanical engineering context extensively along with some Python and C++. In the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp, I added the MERN stack, and some additional tools to my tool belt. With my past job experiences and projects utilizing all these coding languages, I have developed troubleshooting, communication, teamwork and technical skills, and I am still learning every day. As a web developer I bring a well rounded perspective to add logical and elegant solutions to every project I work on. </p>
